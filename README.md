# Traffic_signs_classification
•Goal is to classify traffic signs using convolutional neural network.<br/>
•convolutional neural network with dropout regularization used on Belgium traffic signs data set with accuracy 95.56%.<br/>
•It includes tasks such as image preprocessing, making series convolutions, feature mapping, pooling.<br/>
•It is multi class classification problem with images having different 62 types of labels.<br/>
•Libraries used are keras, sklearn, scipy, numpy, pandas,matplotlib.<br/>
